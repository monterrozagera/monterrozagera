Hello people! I'm @monterrozagera

I finally decided to start a repo just because I guess.. well I'm not really a developer
but I though sharing my projects wouldn't be bad.

What I'm focused on:
  * Security stuff
  * Hacking & Pentesting
  * Some here and there..
  
 I kinda love videogames specially racing ones, would love to have a V10 manual M5 one day <3
 
 Feel free to help me out :)
